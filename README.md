Exercise 2

---

Make a new page with a text input and a button. When the button is clicked, a fetch query is sent to the agify API with the name entered in the input. When the request is finished display the result in a new div on the page. Keep the the past requests on the page by creating a new div each time you make an API call.

Extra steps

---

Also add a select field with a few countries in it, to narrow down the search to a specific country. You'll have to look in agify documentation to know more about that.
Store the previous results in a localStorage so you don't have to fetch them again!
